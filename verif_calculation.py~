"""Methods for spatial and temporal interpolation of precipitation fields."""
# This is slightly modified from interpolation.py: input fields can have several timesteps to them, also verification metrics are being calculated for the interpolated fields.
# This script does the interpolation between images.
# Farneback winsize
# Farneback levels
# predictability
# The script varies each of these one at a time, calculates motion vectors, does interpolation, calculates certain verification metrics and saves the result to a file.

# VERIF METRICS:
# RMSE

# THE PRODUCERS: Verif metrics (always compared against the analysis) are calculated for:
# Persistence forecast
# DMO forecast of different forecast lengths
# Blended AMV interpolated forecast of different forecast lengths and different sensitivity assumptions to them
## Farneback winsize
## Farneback levels
## predictability
# Blended forecast done through linear cross-dissolve of the two fields
